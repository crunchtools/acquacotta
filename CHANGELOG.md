## [Unreleased]

## [2.16.2] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- `acquacotta-base` and `acquacotta-test` never carried a semver tag matching
  the app's release version. `container-base.yml` only had a path-triggered
  push to `main` (Containerfile.base/.test changes) plus `:latest`/`:sha`
  tags -- no `tags: v*` trigger at all, so a release of the main app never
  produced a matching base/test image. Nagios's registry-drift check
  (crunchtools/nagios-agent) expects every image in a repo to carry its
  newest git tag; these silently never did. Added the tag trigger and a
  `docker/metadata-action` semver tag to all four jobs (base + test, Quay +
  GHCR).

## [2.16.1] - 2026-08-01

This changelog starts here (RT #1484). acquacotta has 76 version tags and no
GitHub Releases, so there are no authored release notes to back-fill from.
Reconstructing that history from commit subjects would satisfy the letter of
Constitution II while defeating its purpose, so it has deliberately not been
done. Everything from this version forward is recorded properly.

For history prior to 2.16.1, see `git log` and the tag list.
